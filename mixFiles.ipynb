            "Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002. The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.The name is an ad hoc derivation from the titan Atlas in Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the titans. (The usual form of the word is Atlantean.) The derivation was reflected in the company's logo used from 2011 through to the 2017 re-branding through a blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young's Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.In August 2011, Jay Simons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as \"co-chief executive\". For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.Atlassian has nine offices in six countries: Amsterdam, Austin, New York, San Francisco and Mountain View, California, Manila, Yokohama, Bangalore, and Sydney.\n",
            "The group has over 3,000 employees serving more than 130,000 customers and millions of users.In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million, and Shona Brown was added to its board. On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange, under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.In March 2019, Atlassian's value was US$26.6 billion.

            "Cochlear (ASX: COH) is a medical device company that designs, manufactures and supplies the Nucleus cochlear implant, the Hybrid electro-acoustic implant and the Baha bone conduction implant.Based in Sydney, Cochlear was formed in 1981 with finance from the Australian government to commercialise the implants pioneered by Dr Graeme Clark. Today, the company holds over two-thirds of the worldwide hearing implant market, with more than 250,000 people receiving one of Cochlear's implants since 1982.Cochlear was named Australia's most innovative company in 2002 and 2003, and one of the world's most innovative companies by Forbes in 2011.\n",

            "Nucleus is a system combining an electrical simulation device that is surgically implanted behind a patient's ear, a processor that captures sounds, and an electrode array that relays the sounds to the brain. It is a direct descendant of the original cochlear implants, also known as Nucleus, developed by Dr Graeme Clark in Melbourne during the 1970s. Nucleus was the first cochlear implant to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The system is upgradable, for example by installing a new sound processor, without surgery. Cochlear's latest processor, Nucleus 6, was launched in 2013 after six years of development. It replaced the Nucleus 5 system. In 2011, the Nucleus 5 CI500 series internal implant was recalled with up to a 24% failure rate. In 2013, the Nucleus implant recorded 99% reliability over the last 8 years, more than any similar product.Hybrid is an electro-acoustic system combining a cochlear implant with an acoustic hearing aid, suitable for patients who have residual hearing at low frequencies. The implant of the Hybrid system is a smaller variant of Nucleus, with an electrode that relays only high frequency sounds, while the acoustic component amplifies low frequency sounds and transmits them to the brain through the ordinary nerve pathway. Hybrid was launched in 2008 and won Australian Engineering Excellence and International Design Awards in 2009.Baha (derived from bone anchored hearing aid) is a bone conduction system involving a small titanium implant that is ossointegrated with the bone behind a patient's ear. A sound processor captures sounds, which is passed to the implant and directly transferred to the inner ear through the skull. Baha was originally produced by Swedish biotechnology group Entific Medical Systems before that company was acquired by Cochlear in 2005.\n",

Cochlear spent $128 million on research and development in FY15.In 2011, reports arose of Nucleus model CI500 implants shutting down, although less than 1% of devices were affected and the failures posed no health risks. Cochlear funded a complete recall of the model, with an older version of the Nucleus implant being available as a replacement. The company spent $101.3 million on the recall.\n",

In early stages, Macquarie has commenced development of solar thermal power as a renewable source of energy.\n",
            "AGL announced in April 2015 and reaffirmed in September 2017 that it intends to close the Liddell Power Station in 2022. The closure of this and other coal-burning power stations in Australia has led to the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, to seek advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator on extending the life of a number of them, to head off future power shortages. Turnbull said the government had been advised that if the Liddell plant were to close in 2022, there would be a 1,000 MW gap in base load, dispatchable power generation.In 2018, AGL was among 17 energy businesses that supported the launch of the Energy Charter, a global initiative aimed at bringing together all parts of the power supply chain to give customers more affordable and reliable energy.\n",

(The usual form of the word is Atlantean.) The derivation was reflected in the company's logo used from 2011 through to the 2017 re-branding through a blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young's Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.In August 2011, Jay Simons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as \"co-chief executive\".

            "Cochlear (ASX: COH) is a medical device company that designs, manufactures and supplies the Nucleus cochlear implant, the Hybrid electro-acoustic implant and the Baha bone conduction implant.Based in Sydney, Cochlear was formed in 1981 with finance from the Australian government to commercialise the implants pioneered by Dr Graeme Clark. Today, the company holds over two-thirds of the worldwide hearing implant market, with more than 250,000 people receiving one of Cochlear's implants since 1982.Cochlear was named Australia's most innovative company in 2002 and 2003, and one of the world's most innovative companies by Forbes in 2011.\n",

            "Nucleus is a system combining an electrical simulation device that is surgically implanted behind a patient's ear, a processor that captures sounds, and an electrode array that relays the sounds to the brain. It is a direct descendant of the original cochlear implants, also known as Nucleus, developed by Dr Graeme Clark in Melbourne during the 1970s. Nucleus was the first cochlear implant to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The system is upgradable, for example by installing a new sound processor, without surgery. Cochlear's latest processor, Nucleus 6, was launched in 2013 after six years of development. It replaced the Nucleus 5 system. In 2011, the Nucleus 5 CI500 series internal implant was recalled with up to a 24% failure rate. In 2013, the Nucleus implant recorded 99% reliability over the last 8 years, more than any similar product.Hybrid is an electro-acoustic system combining a cochlear implant with an acoustic hearing aid, suitable for patients who have residual hearing at low frequencies. The implant of the Hybrid system is a smaller variant of Nucleus, with an electrode that relays only high frequency sounds, while the acoustic component amplifies low frequency sounds and transmits them to the brain through the ordinary nerve pathway. Hybrid was launched in 2008 and won Australian Engineering Excellence and International Design Awards in 2009.Baha (derived from bone anchored hearing aid) is a bone conduction system involving a small titanium implant that is ossointegrated with the bone behind a patient's ear. A sound processor captures sounds, which is passed to the implant and directly transferred to the inner ear through the skull. Baha was originally produced by Swedish biotechnology group Entific Medical Systems before that company was acquired by Cochlear in 2005.\n",

Cochlear spent $128 million on research and development in FY15.In 2011, reports arose of Nucleus model CI500 implants shutting down, although less than 1% of devices were affected and the failures posed no health risks. Cochlear funded a complete recall of the model, with an older version of the Nucleus implant being available as a replacement. The company spent $101.3 million on the recall.\n",

They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.The name is an ad hoc derivation from the titan Atlas in Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the titans. (The usual form of the word is Atlantean.) The derivation was reflected in the company's logo used from 2011 through to the 2017 re-branding through a blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young's Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.In August 2011, Jay Simons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as \"co-chief executive\". For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.Atlassian has nine offices in six countries: Amsterdam, Austin, New York, San Francisco and Mountain View, California, Manila, Yokohama, Bangalore, and Sydney.\n",

            "Nucleus is a system combining an electrical simulation device that is surgically implanted behind a patient's ear, a processor that captures sounds, and an electrode array that relays the sounds to the brain. It is a direct descendant of the original cochlear implants, also known as Nucleus, developed by Dr Graeme Clark in Melbourne during the 1970s. Nucleus was the first cochlear implant to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The system is upgradable, for example by installing a new sound processor, without surgery. Cochlear's latest processor, Nucleus 6, was launched in 2013 after six years of development. It replaced the Nucleus 5 system. In 2011, the Nucleus 5 CI500 series internal implant was recalled with up to a 24% failure rate. In 2013, the Nucleus implant recorded 99% reliability over the last 8 years, more than any similar product.Hybrid is an electro-acoustic system combining a cochlear implant with an acoustic hearing aid, suitable for patients who have residual hearing at low frequencies. The implant of the Hybrid system is a smaller variant of Nucleus, with an electrode that relays only high frequency sounds, while the acoustic component amplifies low frequency sounds and transmits them to the brain through the ordinary nerve pathway. Hybrid was launched in 2008 and won Australian Engineering Excellence and International Design Awards in 2009.Baha (derived from bone anchored hearing aid) is a bone conduction system involving a small titanium implant that is ossointegrated with the bone behind a patient's ear. A sound processor captures sounds, which is passed to the implant and directly transferred to the inner ear through the skull. Baha was originally produced by Swedish biotechnology group Entific Medical Systems before that company was acquired by Cochlear in 2005.\n",
